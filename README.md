# React To-Do Application Backend

This project provides a backend server for a To-Do application built using Node.js and Express.js. The backend is designed to work seamlessly with a React frontend. It includes user authentication via email and Google, task creation, updating, viewing, and deletion, all secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) .

## Technology Stack

- **Express.js**: A fast and flexible Node.js web application framework that powers the server.

- **jsonwebtoken**: JSON Web Tokens for secure communication between the server and the client.

- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool for managing the database.

- **dotenv**: A package for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

- **Babel**: Used to transpile the ES6+ JavaScript code for Node.js compatibility.

## To-Do Application Features

1. **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks with or without due dates. The tasks will be stored in the database.

2. **Task Updates**: Users can update any existing task, modifying the task description or due date.

3. **Task List View**: Users can view a list of tasks in a table format, showing task descriptions, due dates, and completion status.

4. **Task Deletion**: Users can delete any task from the list, removing it from the database.

## Authentication

1. **JWT for Security**: JSON Web Tokens are used to secure communication between the server and the client, ensuring only authorized users can access their tasks.

2. **User Registration**: Users can register using their email and password, with their information securely stored in the database.

3. **User Login via Google**: Users can conveniently and securely log in using their Google accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file, including database connection details and JWT secrets.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the server using `npm start`.

Please note that this is a high-level overview of the backend setup. You'll need to implement the functionality step by step, such as setting up routes, handling user authentication, defining the database schema, and more. The specific implementation details can vary based on your project's requirements.

This project combines the power of Node.js and various packages to create a secure and efficient backend for a To-Do application that can be integrated with a frontend built in React. It's a great starting point for developing a feature-rich and secure application to manage tasks and to-dos.

Happy coding!
